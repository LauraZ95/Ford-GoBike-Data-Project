## by (Jingjie Zhao)


## Dataset

> Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips.

> In this project, data consist about 2,507,000 bike rides from January 2019 to December 2019. The original data form a total of 2506983 rows and 15 columns. The attributes include the trip start time and end time, start station id and end station id, start station name and end station name, start station latitude/longitude and end station latitude, user type, rental methods and bike share status.

> This archive contains four files:
> •	Readme.md – This markdown file contains sections like select dataset, exploration, and explanatory analysis.

> •	Exploration_template.ipynb – This Jupyter Notebook contains section templates to help organize my exploration, starting from assessing the dataset, analyze through univariate exploration, bivariate exploration and multivariate exploration. 

> •	Slide_deck_template.ipynb – This Jupter Notebook contains starter cells to help organize my slide deck deliverable.

> •	Output_toggle.tpl – This template file can be used with nbconvert to export my slide deck. This adds extra functionality to the slide deck by hiding the code to start, only visualizations in the case of this project. 




## Summary of Findings

> Ford GoBike System is a fantastic program, which provides bike-renting service for moving around in the city, both for work and travel.
> There are two types of users: Subscribers and Customers.
> There are two rental methods: App and Clipper.
> Subscribers (80.6%) are primarily using GoBike system for daily commute. (Short distance traveling)
> Customers (19.4%) are usually tourists who use the GoBike system to explore the Bay Area.
> App: 90% of the clients prefer to rent bikes through the app.
> Average traveling distance: Travel distances are generally longer in November. This may due to more business trips at the end of the year, and travelers choose to take a vacation after finishing a year of planning.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> Quarterly usage, Monthly usage and Day of Week usage help to polish up for my presentation. Comparing the trends between three graphics can help us understand the demand for Gobike system more comprehensively.
